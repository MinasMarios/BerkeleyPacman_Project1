# BerkeleyPacman_Project1
This is the first project in the Berkeley course CS 188 | Introduction to Artificial Intelligence


The goal of this project is to implement various search algorithms to solve the classic Pac-Man game. You will be writing code to enable Pac-Man to navigate through a maze, collect food pellets, and avoid ghosts. The project consists of several parts, each building on the previous one:

    Part 1: DFS, BFS, UCS Search
    Part 2: A* Search
    Part 3: Suboptimal Search

Each part of the project comes with a set of autograder tests to help you check if your implementation is correct.
